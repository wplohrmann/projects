## Some projects I have done recently and for the past year

### Ising
This is a computing project I did attempting to model a ferromagnet using the Ising model. The folder contains the Ferromagnet.py as its main component, with the other files "running experiments" to produce figures.

### Soccer
This was a mini project I used to learn some machine learning basics.

### Electrocaloric
A selection of some programs I wrote during a placement in 2016 to investigate electrocaloric materials.

### Equivariance
Quantum chemistry predictions on

using a rotationally equivariant CNN.
